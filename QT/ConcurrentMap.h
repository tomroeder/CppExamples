* QtConcurrent::map Example
*
* QtConcurrent::map is used to iterate over a container or sequence and call a function on each element of the container.
* It is expected that your function will modify the element it is called upon in some way.
* In this example I wrote a simple functor that replaces each string with its upper-cased version.
